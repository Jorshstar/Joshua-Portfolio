        This section contains the hero section of the page. It renders a title, a tagline, and a button. 
        The title is responsive and changes size based on the screen size. The tagline is also responsive and changes size based on the screen size. The button is responsive and changes size based on the screen size. The button is also animated and has a "waving hand" emoji when hovered. The hero section also renders a 3D animation and a canvas loader. The canvas loader is a loading animation that appears when the 3D animation is loading. The hero section also renders a target and a react logo. The target is a 3D model of a target and the react logo is a 3D model of the react logo. The 3D animation is rendered inside a group and positioned using the `position` prop. The `position` prop is calculated based on the screen size. The 3D animation is also animated using the `useFrame` hook. The `useFrame` hook is used to update the position of the 3D animation based on the current time. The `useFrame` hook is called every frame and updates the position of the 3D animation. The hero section also renders a perspective camera and a ambient light. The perspective camera is used to render the 3D animation and the ambient light is used to add some ambient light to the scene. The hero section also renders a directional light. The directional light is used to add some light to the scene. The hero section is rendered inside a section element with the class name of "w-full h-full absolute inset-0". The section element is a child of the root element of the page. The section element is used to position the hero section at the top of the page and to make it take up the full width and height of the page. The section element is also used to add some padding to the hero section. The padding is used to add some space between the hero section and the other sections of the page. */}
